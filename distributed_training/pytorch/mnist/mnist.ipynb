    "This notebook trains and evaluates a classifier of handwritten digits (Using the MNIST dataset). The training is distributed across multiple GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are important features and differences in this flow than other examples in this repo, such as the MPI/Tensorflow example.\n",

    "## Container Image\n",
    "The components of this pipeline use a custom built container image as their base image. The Dockerfile is included in GitHub. The container image does *not* include a notebook server, meaning you cannot use it to launch a notebook. The notebook container images from https://quay.io/repository/ibm/kubeflow-notebook-image-ppc64le have a wide range of packages installed in them, and these can be used to start an interactive notebook server. The base image used in this example has installed a much smaller set of newer packages, including Python 3.10 and PyTorch 1.13 from RocketCE. Also included is pytorch-lightning, which makes it easier to code up models for distributed training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since your notebook image and pipeline images are not the same you may be able to run code in the pipeline that does not run interactivly in the notebook. And you may be able to run code interactivly that does not run in the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "The custom image also includes the pytorch_distributed_kf_tools, which simplifies the creation and deployment of the PyTorch Job. The source code for this package is in the GitHub Repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see how the custom image was built and that packages that are included by looking at the Dockerfile.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training Script\n",
    "When using distributed training with GPUs, most PyTorch models are trained within a script that is called from the command line, as opposed to a cell in a interactive notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script to run the model is stored in the GitHub Repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kubeflow train_and_test_model component will create a PyTorch job that runs the script across a pre-defined number of worker pods. The component will then monitor the job and wait for the job's completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is downloaded by the pipeline, rather than being built into the container image. This allows the script to be changed without rebuilding the container image.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Shared Storage\n",
    "The Kubeflow component needs to make the Python script and training data available to the PytorchJob, and it needs to be able to obtain the trained model after training is completed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline will create a Volume as the first step in the pipeline.\n",
    "The pipeline will copy the training data and training script onto this storage so that the workers can access it.\n",
    "After training, the pipeline will copy the model from the shared storage to storage that is accessible outside the pipeline. (The notebook's volume in this example).\n",
