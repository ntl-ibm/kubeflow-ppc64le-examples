    "The example trains a model to detect Honey Bees using the V7 version of the https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5. The purpose of the example is to explain how to train a model using Kubeflow, the YOLOV5 repo and sample data. \n",

For our purposes, we've included a sample of training data to use for this exercise. The poor quantity and quality of the training data will not produce a good model, but it will train quickly, and allow for experimentation with the pipeline.\n",
